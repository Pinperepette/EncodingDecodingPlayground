## Adding New Scripts

To add new encoding or decoding scripts, refer to the structure of the existing scripts in the `decoding_scripts` and `encoding_scripts` folders. Simply create new Python files with your encoding and decoding functions inside these folders. The web application will automatically detect and include them in the dropdown menus for users to choose from.
